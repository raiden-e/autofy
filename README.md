## Lofi â˜•

A script to pick around 250 Lo-Fi songs and drop them into a chilled weekly automated [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5h9LqGUUE4FKQfVwgAu1OA).
Lo-Fi Hip-Hop is some of the chilliest beats you will ever hear, and it helps me study, code, play games and relax.

## Backup ðŸ“š

Spotify has some good playlists. However they get updated sometimes and some songs get removed from them. This script goes through a number of playlists and archives their tracks. Check out the [Night Rider Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5p0qHPgujEMFGSRms689v8) for example.

### Requirements for Backup

You need to go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) and create a gist with a file called `backup.json`

### Image

Automatically adds a playlist to the gist which contians Backup.py 's list of uri's.

## DailySong ðŸŽ¶

Send's a random song from a Spotify playlist to
[Track des Tages](t.me/TrackDesTages),
[Daily Track](t.me/Daily_Track)
and to my
[Discord](https://discord.gg/wDaVDtx)
at 12 PM CEST

## Dubstep ðŸš‘

So I like this genre, but Spotify's algorithms are kind of poor, when it comes to recommandations. Also the personal radar changes wheneven you listen to something new. _Espacially_ when you listen to a songs by popular artists. So I summed up some decent dubstep artists in a [gist](https://gist.github.com). This script pulls the latest releases from those artists and loads them into a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6XnpwiV7hkEUMh4UsMapm2) on a weekly basis. Also if the latest release was an album, it picks the 2-5 most popular tracks from it.

## Now Playing â–¶

Show the currently playing song on Spotify and get the artist, song name, album name and cover.
