## Lofi â˜•

A script to pick around 250 Lo-Fi songs and drop them into a chilled weekly automated [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5h9LqGUUE4FKQfVwgAu1OA).

Lo-Fi Hip-Hop is some of the chilliest beats you will ever hear, and it helps me study, code, play games, and relax.

## Backup ðŸ“š

Spotify has some good playlists. However, they update them sometimes, such that they remove good songs from them.
This script goes through several playlists and archives their tracks.

Check out the [Night Rider Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6GJXiuZRisr) and the [Night Rider Backup](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5p0qHPgujEMFGSRms689v8).

### Requirements for Backup

You need to go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com) and create a gist with a file called `backup.json`

### Image

Automatically adds a playlist to the gist containing Backup.py 's list of URI's.

## DailySong ðŸŽ¶

Send's a random song from a Spotify playlist to
[Track des Tages](t.me/TrackDesTages),
[Daily Track](t.me/Daily_Track),
and my
[Discord](https://discord.gg/wDaVDtx)
at noon CEST.

## Dubstep ðŸš‘

So I like this genre, but Spotify's algorithms are kind of poor when it comes to recommendations.
The personal radar changes whenever you listen to something new. _Especially_ when you recently listened to songs by popular artists.
So I summed up some decent dubstep artists in a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
This script pulls the latest releases from those artists and loads them into a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6XnpwiV7hkEUMh4UsMapm2) every week.
If the latest release was an album, it picks the 2-5 most popular tracks.

## Now Playing â–¶

Show the currently playing song on Spotify and get the artist, song name, album name, and cover.
This script continuously  saves the name of the song, artist, and album in a text file in the user's home folder.

Rename `config_template.py` to `config.py`.
Save your api hashes and id's to `config.py`

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)

Open Powershell/CMD and run the following commands:
