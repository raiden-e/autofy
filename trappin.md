# Trappin in Japan

## For those who wonder what the first song is

[Ã˜fdream - Game Is On](https://youtu.be/F3PluM_H03k)

## So my playlist goes through a process.

I have a playlist called [Trappin in Japan.Backup](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/19yEs2hB6J5FwHrGMsIlZQ) which is a playlist that *more or less* imports a couple of other playlists i found on Spotify.

I also have a playlist with my favorite songs and a gist with songs I wish to be not be included in the weekly mix.

i wrote a [python-script](https://github.com/raiden-e/autofy), that automatically does the following:

1. Grab the favorites playlist.
2. grab the `Backup` and exlude songs that are also in the `gist`
3. from the remaining, choose 250 - `the amount of favorites` songs
4. Randomize the total 250, while leaving one favorite at the top
5. Post to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Cu6fL6djm63Em0i93IRUW)

Hope you enjoy!
